app > Exceptions > Handler.php = Laravel's Exception Handler

When you start a new Laravel project, error and exception handling is already configured for you. The App\Exceptions\Handler class is where all exceptions thrown by your application are logged and then rendered to the user. We'll dive deeper into this class throughout this documentation.
