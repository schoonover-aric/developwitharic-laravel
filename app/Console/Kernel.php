/*
***** What's the purpose of this file? *****

app > Console > Kernel.php = Laravel's Command Scheduler (instead of writing cron configurations/jobs/tasks/etc.)

In the past, you may have written a cron configuration entry for each task you needed to schedule on your server. However, this can quickly become a pain because your task schedule is no longer in source control and you must SSH into your server to view your existing cron entries or add additional entries.

Laravel's command scheduler offers a fresh approach to managing scheduled tasks on your server. The scheduler allows you to fluently and expressively define your command schedule within your Laravel application itself. When using the scheduler, only a single cron entry is needed on your server. Your task schedule is defined in the app/Console/Kernel.php file's schedule method. To help you get started, a simple example is defined within the method.
