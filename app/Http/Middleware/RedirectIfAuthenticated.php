Middleware for authentication/failed authentication
    -the purpose of RedirectIfAuthenticated is to keep an already authenticated user from reaching the login or registration routes/views since they're already logged in / redirects to /home if attempt to visit login page when logged in

Laravel Middleware:
    -Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to your application's login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.
    -Additional middleware can be written to perform a variety of tasks besides authentication. For example, a logging middleware might log all incoming requests to your application. There are several middleware included in the Laravel framework, including middleware for authentication and CSRF protection. All of these middleware are located in the app/Http/Middleware directory.
